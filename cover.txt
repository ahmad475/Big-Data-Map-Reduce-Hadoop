ISSUES:

I had many issues at my first attempt in docker and Hadoop
in docker. I did however switch computers that I was using 
later on and managed to get it to work. But the issues
I was having seemed to be related to "ipc.clent" errors 
where it would time out. not even the built in map reduce
would work. I did loose a lot of time by not being able to 
work on my previous older computer. I also had some issues 
with python were certain methods wouldn't work. When I switched
computers I increased RAM that docker gave my containers perhaps
that helped a little bit I was however able to obtain the 
required output in the end.
